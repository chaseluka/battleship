Project Overview
================

Creating the classic board game, this Battleship project simply allows a player to player to place their ships, while attacking the computer oppenent in a
turn based system. The turns are attacks of both players are shown on both the player and computer boards marking hits and misses. 

The primary objective was to use test driven development (TDD) for the first time. This project also includes practicing using factory funcitons as well as 
developing an intelligent AI. Proir to this was learing about pure functions, and although the main factory functions couldn't adhere to this, many smaller 
functions and objects were made to be pure.
