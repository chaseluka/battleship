Project Overview
================

Creating the classic board game, this Battleship project allows a player to player to place their ships, while attacking and recieving attacks from the computer oppenent in a turn based system. The attacks of both players are shown on both the player and computer boards marking hits and misses. 

The primary objective was to use test driven development (TDD) via Jest for the first time. This project also includes practicing using factory funcitons as well as developing an intelligent AI. Proir to I leared about pure functions, and although the main factory functions couldn't adhere to the principles of pure functions, many smaller functions and objects were made to be pure.
